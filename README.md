### Step1:

clone the tree-sitter module to /libs
```
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp.git
```

### Step2:

install all the requirements for the Repo

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step3:

unzip the dataset in ./dataset, for example:
```
unzip gcj_cpp.zip
```

### Step4:

run test file for test/tree_sitter_test.py to validate tree-sitter is enable

```
python test/tree_sitter_test.py
```

### Step5:

run cmd_batch.py for test

```
python cmd_batch.py
```

for epoch_num=150, the top1 of Forsee is 0.823 (just for test)

the Training Step contains 4 models:
1. Layout Indepentent Model
2. Lexical Indepentent Model
3. Syntact Indepentent Model
4. Forsee Framework
